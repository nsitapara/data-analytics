      "['This set of images from the Instrument Deployment Camera shows NASA\\'s InSight lander placing its first instrument onto the surface of Mars, completing a major mission milestone. Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech. Full image and caption.NASA\\'s InSight lander has deployed its first instrument onto the surface of Mars, completing a major mission milestone. New images from the lander show the seismometer on the ground, its copper-colored covering faintly illuminated in the Martian dusk. It looks as if all is calm and all is bright for InSight, heading into the end of the year.The InSight team has been working carefully toward deploying its two dedicated science instruments onto Martian soil since landing on Mars on Nov. 26. Meanwhile, the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment (RISE), which does not have its own separate instrument, has already begun using InSight\\'s radio connection with Earth to collect preliminary data on the planet’s core. Not enough time has elapsed for scientists to deduce what they want to know — scientists estimate they might have some results starting in about a year.To deploy the seismometer (also known as the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, or SEIS) and the heat probe (also known as the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Probe, or HP3), engineers first had to verify the robotic arm that picks up and places InSight\\'s instruments onto the Martian surface was working properly. Engineers tested the commands for the lander, making sure a model in the test bed at JPL deployed the instruments exactly as intended. Scientists also had to analyze images of the Martian terrain around the lander to figure out the best places to deploy the instruments.On Tuesday, Dec. 18, InSight engineers sent up the commands to the spacecraft. On Wednesday, Dec. 19, the seismometer was gently placed onto the ground directly in front of the lander, about as far away as the arm can reach ---- 5.367 feet, or 1.636 meters, away).\"Seismometer deployment is as important as landing InSight on Mars,\" said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt, also based at JPL. \"The seismometer is the highest-priority instrument on InSight: We need it in order to complete about three-quarters of our science objectives.\"The seismometer allows scientists to peer into the Martian interior by studying ground motion — also known as marsquakes. Each marsquake acts as a kind of flashbulb that illuminates the structure of the planet\\'s interior. By analyzing how seismic waves pass through the layers of the planet, scientists can deduce the depth and composition of these layers.\"Having the seismometer on the ground is like holding a phone up to your ear,\" said Philippe Lognonné, principal investigator of SEIS from Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP) and Paris Diderot University. \"We\\'re thrilled that we\\'re now in the best position to listen to all the seismic waves from below Mars\\' surface and from its deep interior.\"In the coming days, the InSight team will work on leveling the seismometer, which is sitting on ground that is tilted 2 to 3 degrees. The first seismometer science data should begin to flow back to Earth after the seismometer is in the right position.But engineers and scientists at JPL, the French national space agency Centre National d\\'Études Spatiales (CNES) and other institutions affiliated with the SEIS team will need several additional weeks to make sure the returned data are as clear as possible. For one thing, they will check and possibly adjust the seismometer\\'s long, wire-lined tether to minimize noise that could travel along it to the seismometer. Then, in early January, engineers expect to command the robotic arm to place the Wind and Thermal Shield over the seismometer to stabilize the environment around the sensors.Assuming that there are no unexpected issues, the InSight team plans to deploy the heat probe onto the Martian surface by late January. HP3 will be on the east side of the lander\\'s work space, roughly the same distance away from the lander as the seismometer.For now, though, the team is focusing on getting those first bits of seismic data (however noisy) back from the Martian surface.\"We look forward to popping some Champagne when we start to get data from InSight\\'s seismometer on the ground,\" Banerdt added. \"I have a bottle ready for the occasion.\"JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

Like NASA\\'s Curiosity rover, InSight has a full-scale working model at the agency\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. This sister lander, aptly named ForeSight, lets the team test all operations before they happen on Mars.To practice how InSight will place its instruments, JPL engineers built a Martian rock garden modeled on images from the spacecraft\\'s cameras. The team raked, shoveled and patted down a bed of crushed garnet intended to simulate Martian sand. They call the shaping of this gravel-like material \"Marsforming.\"A four-inch (10-centimeter) layer of garnet was added to the lab space in order to match the height and slope of the surface in front of InSight. Donning augmented-reality headsets allowed the team to project digital terrain models of the landing site onto the test bed, checking whether they needed to scoop more gravel into the space or smooth it out. Wood blocks marked the perimeter of the areas where the lander’s seismometer and heat flow probe could be placed; precision cameras in the lab were used to measure each feature they intended to replicate. It took about four hours to mimic every detail, down to any pebbles or rocks larger than an inch (2 centimeters).\"It\\'s great for the science we want to do,\" said JPL\\'s Marleen Sundgaard, who is guiding the test-bed work. \"It\\'s the flat parking lot the landing team promised us. You calculate the probability of rocks in the area and hope the odds are in your favor.\"The odds have been very much in favor for InSight. \"All around us, there are rocks that were ejected from nearby craters. These can be launched miles across the landscape, depending on the impact size,\" said Nate Williams, a JPL post-doctoral researcher working with the mission. \"Thankfully, there just aren\\'t a lot of rocks right in front of us.\"About 70 feet (21 meters) from the lander lies a field of small boulders that would have made Marsforming harder, Williams said. He lent his geologist\\'s eye to the work, selecting rock samples for the test bed that matched the size, shape and locations of those near InSight.Every bit of additional realism in the lab creates a more reliable test. The team spent this past weekend commanding each movement of ForeSight\\'s robotic arm, ensuring that the instrument tethers stayed clear of rocks. By Monday morning, they had confirmed the science team\\'s preferred placements: about 5.4 feet (1.6 meters) directly in front of the lander for the seismometer. The heat flow probe will be placed roughly the same distance from the lander, but about 4 feet (1.2 meters) to the left of the seismometer.The commands to set down InSight\\'s seismometer are being sent to Mars today.

A media teleconference about these sounds will be held today at 12:30 p.m. EST (9:30 a.m. PST).InSight sensors captured a haunting low rumble caused by vibrations from the wind, estimated to be blowing between 10 to 15 mph (5 to 7 meters a second) on Dec. 1, from northwest to southeast. The winds were consistent with the direction of dust devil streaks in the landing area, which were observed from orbit.\"Capturing this audio was an unplanned treat,\" said Bruce Banerdt, InSight principal investigator at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. \"But one of the things our mission is dedicated to is measuring motion on Mars, and naturally that includes motion caused by sound waves.\"Teleconference audio and accompanying visuals will stream live on NASA\\'s website. A follow-along page is available at:https://www.nasa.gov/insightmarswindTwo very sensitive sensors on the spacecraft detected these wind vibrations: an air pressure sensor inside the lander and a seismometer sitting on the lander\\'s deck, awaiting deployment by InSight\\'s robotic arm. The two instruments recorded the wind noise in different ways. The air pressure sensor, part of the Auxiliary Payload Sensor Subsystem (APSS), which will collect meteorological data, recorded these air vibrations directly. The seismometer recorded lander vibrations caused by the wind moving over the spacecraft\\'s solar panels, which are each 7 feet (2.2 meters) in diameter and stick out from the sides of the lander like a giant pair of ears.This is the only phase of the mission during which the seismometer, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS), will be capable of detecting vibrations generated directly by the lander. In a few weeks, it will be placed on the Martian surface by InSight\\'s robotic arm, then covered by a domed shield to protect it from wind and temperature changes. It still will detect the lander\\'s movement, though channeled through the Martian surface. For now, it\\'s recording vibrational data that scientists later will be able to use to cancel out noise from the lander when SEIS is on the surface, allowing them to detect better actual marsquakes.When earthquakes occur on Earth, their vibrations, which bounce around inside our planet, make it \"ring\" similar to how a bell creates sound. InSight will see if tremors, or marsquakes, have a similar effect on Mars. SEIS will detect these vibrations that will tell us about the Red Planet\\'s deep interior. Scientists hope this will lead to new information on the formation of the planets in our solar system, perhaps even of our own planet.SEIS, provided by France\\'s Centre National d\\'Études Spatiales (CNES), includes two sets of seismometers. Those contributed by the French will be used once SEIS is deployed from the deck of the lander. But SEIS also includes short period (SP) silicon sensors developed by Imperial College London with electronics from Oxford University in the United Kingdom. These sensors can work while on the deck of the lander and are capable of detecting vibrations up to frequencies of nearly 50 hertz, at the lower range of human hearing.\"The InSight lander acts like a giant ear,\" said Tom Pike, InSight science team member and sensor designer at Imperial College London. \"The solar panels on the lander\\'s sides respond to pressure fluctuations of the wind. It\\'s like InSight is cupping its ears and hearing the Mars wind beating on it. When we looked at the direction of the lander vibrations coming from the solar panels, it matches the expected wind direction at our landing site.\"Pike compared the effect to a flag in the wind. As a flag breaks up the wind, it creates oscillations in air pressure that the human ear perceives as flapping. Separately, APSS records changes in pressure directly from the thin Martian air.\"That\\'s literally what sound is — changes in air pressure,\" said Don Banfield InSight\\'s science lead for APSS from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. \"You hear that whenever you speak to someone across the room.\"Unlike the vibrations recorded by the short period sensors, audio from APSS is about 10 hertz, below the range of human hearing.The raw audio sample from the seismometer was released unaltered; a second version was raised two octaves to be more perceptible to the human ear — especially when heard through laptop or mobile speakers. The second audio sample from APSS was sped up by a factor of 100, which shifted it up in frequency.An even clearer sound from Mars is yet to come. In just a couple years, NASA\\'s Mars 2020 rover is scheduled to land with two microphones on board. The first, provided by JPL, is included specifically to record, for the first time, the sound of a Mars landing. The second is part of the SuperCam and will be able to detect the sound of the instrument\\'s laser as it zaps different materials.

Two to three months could go by before the instruments have been situated and calibrated.Over the past week and a half, mission engineers have been testing those instruments and spacecraft systems, ensuring they\\'re in working order. A couple instruments are even recording data: a drop in air pressure, possibly caused by a passing dust devil, was detected by the pressure sensor. This, along with a magnetometer and a set of wind and temperature sensors, are part of a package called the Auxiliary Payload Sensor Subsystem, which will collect meteorological data.More images from InSight\\'s arm were scheduled to come down this past weekend. However, imaging was momentarily interrupted, resuming the following day. During the first few weeks in its new home, InSight has been instructed to be extra careful, so anything unexpected will trigger what\\'s called a fault. Considered routine, it causes the spacecraft to stop what it is doing and ask for help from operators on the ground.\"We did extensive testing on Earth. But we know that everything is a little different for the lander on Mars, so faults are not unusual,\" Hoffman said. \"They can delay operations, but we\\'re not in a rush. We want to be sure that each operation that we perform on Mars is safe, so we set our safety monitors to be fairly sensitive initially.\"Spacecraft engineers had already factored extra time into their estimates for instrument deployment to account for likely delays caused by faults.

They knew when InSight landed on Nov. 26 that the spacecraft had touched down on target, a lava plain named Elysium Planitia. Now they\\'ve determined that the vehicle sits slightly tilted (about 4 degrees) in a shallow dust- and sand-filled impact crater known as a \"hollow.\" InSight has been engineered to operate on a surface with an inclination up to 15 degrees.\"The science team had been hoping to land in a sandy area with few rocks since we chose the landing site, so we couldn\\'t be happier,\" said InSight project manager Tom Hoffman of JPL. \"There are no landing pads or runways on Mars, so coming down in an area that is basically a large sandbox without any large rocks should make instrument deployment easier and provide a great place for our mole to start burrowing.\"Rockiness and slope grade factor into landing safety and are also important in determining whether InSight can succeed in its mission after landing. Rocks and slopes could affect InSight\\'s ability to place its heat-flow probe — also known as \"the mole,\" or HP3 — and ultra-sensitive seismometer, known as SEIS, on the surface of Mars.Touching down on an overly steep slope in the wrong direction could also have jeopardized the spacecraft\\'s ability to get adequate power output from its two solar arrays, while landing beside a large rock could have prevented InSight from being able to open one of those arrays. In fact, both arrays fully deployed shortly after landing.The InSight science team\\'s preliminary assessment of the photographs taken so far of the landing area suggests the area in the immediate vicinity of the lander is populated by only a few rocks. Higher-resolution images are expected to begin arriving over the coming days, after InSight releases the clear-plastic dust covers that kept the optics of the spacecraft\\'s two cameras safe during landing.\"We are looking forward to higher-definition pictures to confirm this preliminary assessment,\" said JPL\\'s Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator of InSight. \"If these few images — with resolution-reducing dust covers on — are accurate, it bodes well for both instrument deployment and the mole penetration of our subsurface heat-flow experiment.\"  Once sites on the Martian surface have been carefully selected for the two main instruments, the team will unstow and begin initial testing of the mechanical arm that will place them there. Data downlinked from the lander also indicate that during its first full day on Mars, the solar-powered InSight spacecraft generated more electrical power than any previous vehicle on the surface of Mars.\"It is great to get our first \\'off-world record\\' on our very first full day on Mars,\" said Hoffman. \"But even better than the achievement of generating more electricity than any mission before us is what it represents for performing our upcoming engineering tasks. The 4,588 watt-hours we produced during sol 1 means we currently have more than enough juice to perform these tasks and move forward with our science mission.\" Launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California May 5, InSight will operate on the surface for one Martian year, plus 40 Martian days, or sols — the equivalent of nearly two Earth years.

After cruising along behind NASA\\'s InSight for seven months, they successfully relayed data back down to Earth from the lander during its descent to the Martian surface on Monday, Nov. 26.Nicknamed \"EVE\" and \"WALL-E\" after the stars of the 2008 Pixar film, MarCO-A and MarCO-B used experimental radios and antennas, providing an alternate way for engineers to monitor the landing. The CubeSats provided information to InSight\\'s landing team in just 8 minutes — the time it took for radio signals to travel from Mars to Earth. That was much faster than waiting on NASA\\'s Mars orbiters, which weren\\'t positioned to be able to observe the entire event and send data back to Earth immediately.\"WALL-E and EVE performed just as we expected them to,\" said MarCO chief engineer Andy Klesh of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which built the CubeSats. \"They were an excellent test of how CubeSats can serve as \\'tag-alongs\\' on future missions, giving engineers up-to-the-minute feedback during a landing.\"Landing on Mars is exceptionally difficult: Before InSight, only about 40 percent of all attempts by various nations had succeeded. Even if a spacecraft doesn\\'t survive landing, having a \"black box\" — or a pair of them, as with MarCO — to record the event can help engineers design better landing technology.Neither of the MarCO CubeSats carry science instruments, but that didn\\'t stop the team from testing whether future CubeSats could perform useful science at Mars. As MarCO-A flew by, it conducted some impromptu radio science, transmitting signals through the edge of Mars\\' atmosphere. Interference from the Martian atmosphere changes the signal when received on Earth, allowing scientists to determine how much atmosphere is present and, to some degree, what it\\'s made of.\"CubeSats have incredible potential to carry cameras and science instruments out to deep space,\" said John Baker, JPL\\'s program manager for small spacecraft. \"They\\'ll never replace the more capable spacecraft NASA is best known for developing. But they\\'re low-cost ride-alongs that can allow us to explore in new ways.\"As a bonus, some consumer-grade cameras aboard MarCO provided \"drive-by\" images as the CubeSats sailed past Mars. MarCO-B was programmed to turn so that it could image the planet in a sequence of shots as it approached Mars (before launch, MarCO-A\\'s cameras were found to be either non-functioning or too blurry to use).After the landing, MarCO-B turned backward to take a farewell shot of the Red Planet. It also attempted to snap some photos of Mars\\' moons, Phobos and Deimos.\"WALL-E sent some great postcards from Mars!\" said Cody Colley of JPL, MarCO\\'s mission manager, who led the work to program each CubeSat to take images. \"It\\'s been exciting to see the view from almost 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) above the surface.\"With the mission\\'s objectives reached, the MarCO team will spend the next couple of weeks collecting additional data on each CubeSat. Of interest will be how much fuel is left in each CubeSat and detailed analyses of how their relay capability performed.There\\'s also sure to be more celebrating among the team.\"MarCO is mostly made up of early-career engineers and, for many, MarCO is their first experience out of college on a NASA mission,\" said Joel Krajewski of JPL, MarCO\\'s project manager. \"We are proud of their accomplishment.

But tomorrow begins an exciting new chapter for InSight: surface operations and the beginning of the instrument deployment phase.\"InSight\\'s twin solar arrays are each 7 feet (2.2 meters) wide; when they\\'re open, the entire lander is about the size of a big 1960s convertible. Mars has weaker sunlight than Earth because it\\'s much farther away from the Sun. But the lander doesn\\'t need much to operate: The panels provide 600 to 700 watts on a clear day, enough to power a household blender and plenty to keep its instruments conducting science on the Red Planet. Even when dust covers the panels — what is likely to be a common occurrence on Mars — they should be able to provide at least 200 to 300 watts.The panels are modeled on those used with NASA\\'s Phoenix Mars Lander, though InSight’s are slightly larger in order to provide more power output and to increase their structural strength. These changes were necessary to support operations for one full Mars year (two Earth years).In the coming days, the mission team will unstow InSight\\'s robotic arm and use the attached camera to snap photos of the ground so that engineers can decide where to place the spacecraft\\'s scientific instruments. It will take two to three months before those instruments are fully deployed and sending back data.In the meantime, InSight will use its weather sensors and magnetometer to take readings from its landing site at Elysium Planitia — its new home on Mars.About InSightJPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

NASA\\'s Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) lander successfully touched down on the Red Planet after an almost seven-month, 300-million-mile (485-million-kilometer) journey from Earth.InSight\\'s two-year mission will be to study the deep interior of Mars to learn how all celestial bodies with rocky surfaces, including Earth and the Moon, formed.  InSight launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California May 5. The lander touched down Monday, Nov. 26, near Mars\\' equator on the western side of a flat, smooth expanse of lava called Elysium Planitia, at 11:52:59 a.m. PST (2:52:59 p.m. EST).\"Today, we successfully landed on Mars for the eighth time in human history,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. \"InSight will study the interior of Mars and will teach us valuable science as we prepare to send astronauts to the Moon and later to Mars. This accomplishment represents the ingenuity of America and our international partners, and it serves as a testament to the dedication and perseverance of our team. The best of NASA is yet to come, and it is coming soon.\"The landing signal was relayed to NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, via NASA\\'s two small experimental Mars Cube One (MarCO) CubeSats, which launched on the same rocket as InSight and followed the lander to Mars. They are the first CubeSats sent into deep space. After successfully carrying out a number of communications and in-flight navigation experiments, the twin MarCOs were set in position to receive transmissions during InSight\\'s entry, descent and landing.From Fast to Slow\"We hit the Martian atmosphere at 12,300 mph (19,800 kilometers per hour), and the whole sequence to touching down on the surface took only six-and-a-half minutes,\" said InSight project manager Tom Hoffman at JPL. \"During that short span of time, InSight had to autonomously perform dozens of operations and do them flawlessly — and by all indications that is exactly what our spacecraft did.\"  Confirmation of a successful touchdown is not the end of the challenges of landing on the Red Planet. InSight\\'s surface-operations phase began a minute after touchdown. One of its first tasks is to deploy its two decagonal solar arrays, which will provide power. That process begins 16 minutes after landing and takes another 16 minutes to complete.The InSight team expects a confirmation later Monday that the spacecraft\\'s solar panels successfully deployed. Verification will come from NASA\\'s Odyssey spacecraft, currently orbiting Mars. That signal is expected to reach InSight\\'s mission control at JPL about five-and-a-half hours after landing.\"We are solar powered, so getting the arrays out and operating is a big deal,\" said Tom Hoffman at JPL. \"With the arrays providing the energy we need to start the cool science operations, we are well on our way to thoroughly investigate what\\'s inside of Mars for the very first time.\"InSight will begin to collect science data within the first week after landing, though the teams will focus mainly on preparing to set InSight\\'s instruments on the Martian ground. At least two days after touchdown, the engineering team will begin to deploy InSight\\'s 5.9-foot-long (1.8-meter-long) robotic arm so that it can take images of the landscape.\"Landing was thrilling, but I\\'m looking forward to the drilling,\" said InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt of JPL. \"When the first images come down, our engineering and science teams will hit the ground running, beginning to plan where to deploy our science instruments.

The mission objectives of the two small MarCOs which relayed InSight’s telemetry was completed after their Martian flyby.\"That\\'s one giant leap for our intrepid, briefcase-sized robotic explorers,\" said Joel Krajewski, MarCO project manager at JPL. \"I think CubeSats have a big future beyond Earth\\'s orbit, and the MarCO team is happy to trailblaze the way.\"With InSight\\'s landing at Elysium Planitia, NASA has successfully soft-landed a vehicle on the Red Planet eight times.\"Every Mars landing is daunting, but now with InSight safely on the surface we get to do a unique kind of science on Mars,\" said JPL director Michael Watkins. \"The experimental MarCO CubeSats have also opened a new door to smaller planetary spacecraft.

At 1:47 p.m. PST (4:47 p.m. EST) engineers successfully conducted a last trajectory correction maneuver to steer the spacecraft within a few kilometers of its targeted entry point over Mars. Engineers still need to conduct a last trajectory correction maneuver to steer the spacecraft toward its entry point over Mars. About two hours before hitting the atmosphere, the entry, descent and landing (EDL) team might also upload some final tweaks to the algorithm that guides the spacecraft safely to the surface.These will be the last commands issued to InSight before it robotically guides itself the rest of the way.

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech. Full image and captionMars and Earth are like two siblings who have grown apart.There was a time when their resemblance was uncanny: Both were warm, wet and shrouded in thick atmospheres. But 3 or 4 billion years ago, these two worlds took different paths.We may soon know why they went their separate ways. NASA\\'s InSight spacecraft will arrive at the Red Planet on Monday, Nov. 26, and will allow scientists to compare Earth to its rusty sibling like never before.InSight (short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) won\\'t be looking for life on Mars. But studying its insides — what it\\'s made of, how that material is layered and how much heat seeps out of it — could help scientists better understand how a planet\\'s starting materials make it more or less likely to support life.\"Earth and Mars were molded out of very similar stuff,\" said Bruce Banerdt, InSight\\'s principal investigator at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which leads the mission. \"Why did the finished planets turn out so differently? Our measurements will help us turn back the clock and understand what produced a verdant Earth but a desolate Mars.\"Serving Life on a PlateLong ago, Mars stopped changing, while Earth continued to evolve.Earth developed a kind of geological \"conveyer belt\" that Mars never had: tectonic plates. When they converge, they can push the crust into the planet. When they move apart, they enable new crust to emerge.This churning of material brings more than just rock to the surface. Some of life\\'s most vital ingredients are so-called volatiles, which include water, carbon dioxide and methane. Because they change into gas easily (that\\'s what makes them volatile), they can be released by tectonic action.The fact that Mars doesn\\'t have tectonic plates suggests its crust was never recycled back into the planet\\'s interior. Could the appearance of life depend on whether tectonic plates are present to churn up volatiles?\"One of our key questions regarding habitability is, what are the key conditions planets need for life to form?\" said Sue Smrekar, InSight\\'s deputy principal investigator at JPL. \"Understanding a planet\\'s initial building blocks set the stage for how processes that affect the environment evolve over time.\"InSight could help answer these questions by using a seismometer, called Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS), to watch how quakes — which can be caused by processes other than just tectonic action — travel through Mars. Understanding how the planet is layered will help scientists work backward, piecing together how dust, metals and ices in the early solar system combined to form the Red Planet.  Red Hot MarsEvery rocky planet traps a reserve of heat in its interior. Some is trapped when a planet forms; the rest comes from radioactive materials decaying over time. That heat then gradually wends its way to the surface, melting rock layers, fracturing crust and creating volcanoes that belch out volatile gases.Heat is important for several reasons. It could have created hot springs early in Martian history, warming the subsurface from below. It could have spewed steam out of volcanoes that later condensed into streams and oceans.By measuring Mars\\' internal temperature with a probe, called Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3), InSight could help explain how heat shaped the planet\\'s surface, making it more or less habitable over time.A Naked PlanetHeat keeps a planet\\'s core molten and flowing. Metallic elements in that core generate electric currents as they move, producing a magnetic field. That magnetic field is like invisible armor, shielding a planet — and any life-forms that may be on it — against radiation.Mars once had a strong magnetic field; many of the oldest parts of the planet\\'s crust are highly magnetized. But billions of years ago, most of this field disappeared, leaving Mars unprotected.To better understand why Mars\\' magnetic field vanished, InSight\\'s scientists want to learn more about the planet\\'s core. Whether the core is liquid, solid or a combination of both affects how the planet wobbles on its axis, just like the liquid yolk inside a spinning, raw egg will result in a different wobble than the denser, solid yolk of a cooked egg.A radio experiment, called Rotation and Structure Experiment (RISE), will help InSight\\'s scientists measure Mars\\' wobble. Combined with data about the planet\\'s layers and heat, the findings will make it possible to piece together how Mars lost its magnetic field.Mars\\' wobble, tectonic activity and heat flow — all three can help explain what set these planetary siblings on different roads, only one of which provides much better conditions for life today.\"Mars is a laboratory for how all these processes happen early in a planet\\'s formation,\" Smrekar said. \"InSight will help constrain our models of how planets are made and change over time.\"About InSightJPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

Western Isidis presents some of the oldest and most scientifically interesting landscapes Mars has to offer. Mission scientists believe the 28-mile-wide (45-kilometer-wide) crater, once home to an ancient river delta, could have collected and preserved ancient organic molecules and other potential signs of microbial life from the water and sediments that flowed into the crater billions of years ago.Jezero Crater\\'s ancient lake-delta system offers many promising sampling targets of at least five kinds of rock, including clays and carbonates that have high potential to preserve signatures of past life.

Along with the massive nearby river delta and small crater impacts, the site contains numerous boulders and rocks to the east, cliffs to the west and depressions filled with aeolian bedforms (wind-derived ripples in sand that could trap a rover) in several locations.\"The Mars community has long coveted the scientific value of sites such as Jezero Crater, and a previous mission contemplated going there, but the challenges with safely landing were considered prohibitive,\" said Ken Farley, project scientist for Mars 2020 at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"But what was once out of reach is now conceivable, thanks to the 2020 engineering team and advances in Mars entry, descent and landing technologies.\"When the landing site search began, mission engineers already had refined the landing system such that they were able to reduce the Mars 2020 landing zone to an area 50 percent smaller than that for the landing of NASA\\'s Curiosity rover at Gale Crater in 2012. This allowed the science community to consider more challenging landing sites. The sites of greatest scientific interest led NASA to add a new capability called Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN). TRN will enable the \"sky crane\" descent stage, the rocket-powered system that carries the rover down to the surface, to avoid hazardous areas.The site selection is dependent upon extensive analyses and verification testing of the TRN capability. A final report will be presented to an independent review board and NASA Headquarters in the fall of 2019.\"Nothing has been more difficult in robotic planetary exploration than landing on Mars,\" said Zurbuchen. \"The Mars 2020 engineering team has done a tremendous amount of work to prepare us for this decision. The team will continue its work to truly understand the TRN system and the risks involved, and we will review the findings independently to reassure we have maximized our chances for success.\"Selecting a landing site this early allows the rover drivers and science operations team to optimize their plans for exploring Jezero Crater once the rover is safely on the ground. Using data from NASA\\'s fleet of Mars orbiters, they will map the terrain in greater detail and identify regions of interest – places with the most interesting geological features, for example – where Mars 2020 could collect the best science samples.The Mars 2020 Project at JPL manages rover development for SMD.

Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech. Full image and caption. What\\'s the sound of a touchdown on Mars?If you\\'re at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, it sounds like winning the Super Bowl: cheers, laughter and lots of hollering.But in the minutes before that, NASA\\'s InSight team will be monitoring the Mars lander\\'s radio signals using a variety of spacecraft — and even radio telescopes here on Earth — to suss out what\\'s happening 91 million miles (146 million km) away.Because these signals are captured by several spacecraft, they\\'re relayed to Earth in different ways and at different times. That means the mission team may know right away when InSight touches down, or they may have to wait up to several hours.Here\\'s how NASA will be listening for the next Mars landing on Nov. 26.Radio TelescopesAs the InSight lander descends into Mars\\' atmosphere, it will broadcast simple radio signals called \"tones\" back to Earth. Engineers will be tuning in from two locations: the National Science Foundation\\'s Green Bank Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia and the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy’s facility at Effelsberg, Germany. Their results will be relayed to Mission Control at JPL and engineers at Lockheed Martin Space in Denver.These tones don\\'t reveal much information, but radio engineers can interpret them to track key events during InSight\\'s entry, descent and landing (EDL). For example, when InSight deploys its parachute, a shift in velocity changes the frequency of the signal. This is caused by what\\'s called the Doppler effect, which is the same thing that occurs when you hear a siren change in pitch as an ambulance goes by. Looking for signals like these will allow the team to know how InSight\\'s EDL is progressing.Mars Cube One (MarCO)Two briefcase-sized spacecraft are flying behind InSight and will attempt to relay its signals to Earth. Belonging to a class of spacecraft called CubeSats, the MarCOs are being tested as a way for future missions to send home data during EDL.The MarCOs are experimental technology. But if they work as they should, the pair will transmit the whole story of EDL as it\\'s unfolding. That might include an image from InSight of the Martian surface right after the lander touches down.InSightAfter it touches down, InSight will essentially yell, \"I made it!\" Seven minutes later, the spacecraft says it again — but a little louder and clearer.The first time, it will communicate with a tone beacon that the radio telescopes will try to detect. The second time, it will send a \"beep\" from its more powerful X-band antenna, which should now be pointed at Earth. This beep includes slightly more information and is only heard if the spacecraft is in a healthy, functioning state. If NASA\\'s Deep Space Network picks up this beep, it\\'s a good sign that InSight survived landing. Engineers will need to wait until early evening to find out if the lander successfully deployed its solar arrays.Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)Besides the MarCO CubeSats, NASA\\'s MRO will be soaring over Mars, recording InSight\\'s data during descent.MRO will hold on to the data it records during EDL as it disappears over the Martian horizon. When it comes back around from the other side, it will play back that data for engineers to study. By 3 p.m. PST (6 p.m. EST), they should be able to piece together MRO\\'s recording of the landing.MRO\\'s recording is similar to an airplane\\'s black box, which means that it could also prove important if InSight doesn\\'t successfully touch down.2001 Mars OdysseyNASA\\'s longest-lived spacecraft at Mars will also relay data after InSight has touched down. Odyssey will relay the entire history of InSight\\'s descent to Mars, as well as a couple images. It will also relay confirmation that InSight\\'s solar arrays, which are vital to the spacecraft\\'s survival, fully deployed. Engineers will have this data just before 5:30 p.m. PST (8:30 p.m. EST).Odyssey will also serve as a data relay for InSight during surface operations, along with MRO, NASA\\'s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission (MAVEN) and the European Space Agency\\'s Trace Gas Orbiter.About InSightJPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

This was Curiosity\\'s longest drive since experiencing a memory anomaly on Sept. 15. The rover switched to a spare computer, called the Side-A computer, on Oct. 3. After more than two weeks of science operations, and now with this latest drive, the mission is back to business. The team plans to drill a new target later this week.Curiosity\\'s engineering team at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory continues to diagnose the anomaly on the Side-B computer.Original story posted October 3, 2018\\nCuriosity Rover to Temporarily Switch \\'Brains\\'Engineers at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, this week commanded the agency\\'s Curiosity rover to switch to its second computer. The switch will enable engineers to do a detailed diagnosis of a technical issue that has prevented the rover\\'s active computer from storing science and some key engineering data since Sept. 15. Like many NASA spacecraft, Curiosity was designed with two, redundant computers -- in this case, referred to as a Side-A and a Side-B computer -- so that it can continue operations if one experiences a glitch. After reviewing several options, JPL engineers recommended that the rover switch from Side B to Side A, the computer the rover used initially after landing.The rover continues to send limited engineering data stored in short-term memory when it connects to a relay orbiter. It is otherwise healthy and receiving commands. But whatever is preventing Curiosity from storing science data in long-term memory is also preventing the storage of the rover\\'s event records, a journal of all its actions that engineers need in order to make a diagnosis. The computer swap will allow data and event records to be stored on the Side-A computer.Side A experienced hardware and software issues over five years ago on sol 200 of the mission, leaving the rover uncommandable and running down its battery. At that time, the team successfully switched to Side B. Engineers have since diagnosed and quarantined the part of Side A\\'s memory that was affected so that computer is again available to support the mission.\"At this point, we\\'re confident we\\'ll be getting back to full operations, but it\\'s too early to say how soon,\" said Steven Lee of JPL, Curiosity\\'s deputy project manager. \"We are operating on Side A starting today, but it could take us time to fully understand the root cause of the issue and devise workarounds for the memory on Side B.\"We spent the last week checking out Side A and preparing it for the swap,\" Lee said. \"It\\'s certainly possible to run the mission on the Side-A computer if we really need to. But our plan is to switch back to Side B as soon as we can fix the problem to utilize its larger memory size.\" For more about Curiosity, visit:\\nhttps://mars.nasa.gov/msl/For more about NASA\\'s Mars program, visit:\\nhttps://mars.nasa.govNews Media ContactAndrew Good\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\\n818-393-2433\\nandrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov', 'No doubt about it, NASA explores some of the most awe-inspiring locations in our solar system and beyond. Once seen, who can forget the majesty of astronaut Jim Irwin standing before the stark beauty of the Moon\\'s Hadley Apennine mountain range, of the Hubble Space Telescope\\'s gorgeous \"Pillars of Creation\" or Cassini\\'s magnificent mosaic of Saturn?Mars also plays a part in this visually compelling equation, with the high-definition imagery from the Curiosity rover of the ridges and rounded buttes at the base of Mount Sharp bringing to mind the majesty of the American Southwest. That said, Elysium Planitia – the site chosen for the Nov. 26 landing of NASA\\'s InSight mission to Mars – will more than likely never be mentioned with those above because it is, well, plain. \"If Elysium Planitia were a salad, it would consist of romaine lettuce and kale – no dressing,\" said InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"If it were an ice cream, it would be vanilla.\"Yes, the landing site of NASA\\'s next Mars mission may very well look like a stadium parking lot, but that is the way the Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) project likes it.\"Previous missions to the Red Planet have investigated its surface by studying its canyons, volcanoes, rocks and soil,\" said Banerdt. \"But the signatures of the planet\\'s formation processes can be found only by sensing and studying evidence buried far below the surface. It is InSight\\'s job to study the deep interior of Mars, taking the planet\\'s vital signs – its pulse, temperature and reflexes.\"Taking those vital signs will help the InSight science team look back to a time when the rocky planets of the solar system formed. The investigations will depend on three instruments:A six-sensor seismometer called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) will record seismic waves traveling through the interior structure of the planet. Studying seismic waves will tell scientists what might be creating the waves. (On Mars, scientists suspect that the culprits may be marsquakes or meteorites striking the surface.)The mission\\'s Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3) will burrow deeper than any other scoop, drill or probe on Mars before to gauge how much heat is flowing out of the planet. Its observations will shed light on whether Earth and Mars are made of the same stuff.Finally, InSight\\'s Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment (RISE) experiment will use the lander\\'s radios to assess the wobble of Mars\\' rotation axis, providing information about the planet\\'s core.For InSight to do its work, the team needed a landing site that checked off several boxes, because as a three-legged lander – not a rover – InSight will remain wherever it touches down.\"Picking a good landing site on Mars is a lot like picking a good home: It\\'s all about location, location, location,\" said Tom Hoffman, InSight project manager at JPL. \"And for the first time ever, the evaluation for a Mars landing site had to consider what lay below the surface of Mars. We needed not just a safe place to land, but also a workspace that\\'s penetrable by our 16-foot-long (5-meter) heat-flow probe.\"The site also needs to be bright enough and warm enough to power the solar cells while keeping its electronics within temperature limits for an entire Martian year (26 Earth months).So the team focused on a band around the equator, where the lander\\'s solar array would have adequate sunlight to power its systems year-round. Finding an area that would be safe enough for InSight to land and then deploy its solar panels and instruments without obstructions took a little longer.\"The site has to be a low-enough elevation to have sufficient atmosphere above it for a safe landing, because the spacecraft will rely first on atmospheric friction with its heat shield and then on a parachute digging into Mars\\' tenuous atmosphere for a large portion of its deceleration,\" said Hoffman. \"And after the chute has fallen away and the braking rockets have kicked in for final descent, there needs to be a flat expanse to land on – not too undulating and relatively free of rocks that could tip the tri-legged Mars lander.\"Of 22 sites considered, only Elysium Planitia, Isidis Planitia and Valles Marineris met the basic engineering constraints. To grade the three remaining contenders, reconnaissance images from NASA\\'s Mars orbiters were scoured and weather records searched. Eventually, Isidis Planitia and Valles Marineris were ruled out for being too rocky and windy.That left the 81-mile long, 17-mile-wide (130-kilometer-long, 27-kilometer-wide) landing ellipse on the western edge of a flat, smooth expanse of lava plain.\"If you were a Martian coming to explore Earth\\'s interior like we are exploring Mars\\' interior, it wouldn\\'t matter if you put down in the middle of Kansas or the beaches of Oahu,\" said Banerdt. \"While I\\'m looking forward to those first images from the surface, I am even more eager to see the first data sets revealing what is happening deep below our landing pads. The beauty of this mission is happening below the surface. Elysium Planitia is perfect.\"After a 205-day journey that began on May 5, NASA\\'s InSight mission will touch down on Mars on Nov. 26 a little before 3 p.m. EST (12 p.m. PST). Its solar panels will unfurl within a few hours of touchdown.

This view shows the underside of the spacecraft..  Full image & caption ›Every Mars landing is a knuckle-whitening feat of engineering. But each attempt has its own quirks based on where a spacecraft is going and what kind of science the mission intends to gather.On Nov. 26, NASA will try to safely set a new spacecraft on Mars. InSight is a lander dedicated to studying the deep interior of the planet – the first mission ever to do so.Here are a few things to know about InSight\\'s landing.Landing on Mars is hardOnly about 40 percent of the missions ever sent to Mars – by any space agency – have been successful. The U.S. is the only nation whose missions have survived a Mars landing. The thin atmosphere – just 1 percent of Earth\\'s – means that there\\'s little friction to slow down a spacecraft. Despite that, NASA has had a long and successful track record at Mars. Since 1965, it has flown by, orbited, landed on and roved across the surface of the Red Planet.InSight uses tried-and-true technologyIn 2008, NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, successfully landed the Phoenix spacecraft at Mars\\' North Pole. InSight is based on the Phoenix spacecraft, both of which were built by Lockheed Martin Space in Denver. Despite tweaks to its heat shield and parachute, the overall landing design is still very much the same: After separating from a cruise stage, an aeroshell descends through the atmosphere. The parachute and retrorockets slow the spacecraft down, and suspended legs absorb some shock from the touchdown.InSight is landing on \"the biggest parking lot on Mars\"One of the benefits of InSight\\'s science instruments is that they can record equally valuable data regardless of where they are on the planet. That frees the mission from needing anything more complicated than a flat, solid surface (ideally with few boulders and rocks). For the mission\\'s team, the landing site at Elysium Planitia is sometimes thought as \"the biggest parking lot on Mars.\"InSight was built to land in a dust stormInSight’s engineers have built a tough spacecraft, able to touch down safely in a dust storm if it needs to. The spacecraft\\'s heat shield is designed to be thick enough to withstand being \"sandblasted\" by dust. Its parachute has suspension lines that were tested to be stronger than Phoenix\\'s, in case it faces more air resistance due to the atmospheric conditions expected during a dust storm.The entry, descent and landing sequence also has some flexibility to handle shifting weather. The mission team will be receiving daily weather updates from NASA\\'s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in the days before landing so that they can tweak when InSight\\'s parachute deploys and when it uses radar to find the Martian surface.After landing, InSight will provide new science about rocky planetsInSight will teach us about the interior of planets like our own. The mission team hopes that by studying the deep interior of Mars, we can learn how other rocky worlds, including Earth and the Moon, formed. Our home planet and Mars were molded from the same primordial stuff more than 4.5 billion years ago but then became quite different. Why didn’t they share the same fate?When it comes to rocky planets, we’ve only studied one in detail: Earth. By comparing Earth\\'s interior to that of Mars, InSight\\'s team members hope to better understand our solar system. What they learn might even aid the search for Earth-like exoplanets, narrowing down which ones might be able to support life. So while InSight is a Mars mission, it’s also much more than a Mars mission.You can read more about how the science of the mission is unique here.

Winds could increase in the next few months at Opportunity\\'s location on Mars, resulting in dust being blown off the rover\\'s solar panels. The agency will reassess the situation in the January 2019 time frame.Updated at 2:15 p.m. PDT on Oct. 11, 2018\\nOne month since increasing their commanding frequency, engineers have yet to hear from NASA\\'s Opportunity rover.NASA hasn\\'t set any deadlines for the mission but will be briefed later this month on the progress and prospects for the recovery campaign being carried out at the agency\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.JPL engineers are employing a combination of listening and commanding methods in case Opportunity is still operational. It\\'s possible that a layer of dust deposited on the rover\\'s solar panels by the recent global dust storm is blocking sunlight that could recharge its batteries. No one can tell just how much dust has been deposited on its panels.A windy period on Mars -- known to Opportunity\\'s team as \"dust-clearing season\" -- occurs in the November-to-January time frame and has helped clean the rover\\'s panels in the past. The team remains hopeful that some dust clearing may result in hearing from the rover in this period.Opportunity has exceeded its expected lifespan many times over. Both Opportunity and its twin, Spirit, were designed to last only 90 days on the Martian surface, with the expectation that the planet\\'s extreme winters and dust storms could cut their mission short. The rover has lasted nearly 15 years: It last communicated on June 10 before being forced into hibernation by the growing dust storm.Updated at 2:45 p.m. PDT on Sept. 11, 2018Scientists reviewing data from the Mars Color Imager (MARCI) aboard NASA\\'s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) have determined that the tau estimate (a measure of the amount of haze in the Martian atmosphere) in the skies above the rover Opportunity has been below 1.5 for two consecutive measurements. With more sunlight reaching the rover\\'s solar array, the Opportunity team at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, are increasing the frequency of commands it beams to the 14-plus-year-old rover via the dishes of NASA\\'s Deep Space Network from three times a week to multiple times per day. Passive listening for Opportunity will also continue to be performed by JPL\\'s Radio Science Group, which records radio signals emanating from Mars with a very sensitive broadband receiver.The original story has been updated in paragraph six to reflect NASA review at each step of the recovery process. Updates on the 2018 dust storm and tau can be found here.Original story posted August 30, 2018A planet-encircling dust storm on Mars, which was first detected May 30 and halted operations for the Opportunity rover, continues to abate.With clearing skies over Opportunity’s resting spot in Mars’ Perseverance Valley, engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, believe the nearly 15-year-old, solar-powered rover will soon receive enough sunlight to automatically initiate recovery procedures -- if the rover is able to do so. To prepare, the Opportunity mission team has developed a two-step plan to provide the highest probability of successfully communicating with the rover and bringing it back online.“The Sun is breaking through the haze over Perseverance Valley, and soon there will be enough sunlight present that Opportunity should be able to recharge its batteries,” said John Callas, Opportunity project manager at JPL. “When the tau level [a measure of the amount of particulate matter in the Martian sky] dips below 1.5, we will begin a period of actively attempting to communicate with the rover by sending it commands via the antennas of NASA’s Deep Space Network. Assuming that we hear back from Opportunity, we will begin the process of discerning its status and bringing it back online.”The rover’s last communication with Earth was received June 10, and Opportunity’s current health is unknown. Opportunity engineers are relying on the expertise of Mars scientists analyzing data from the Mars Color Imager (MARCI) aboard NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) to estimate the tau near the rover’s position.“The dust haze produced by the Martian global dust storm of 2018 is one of the most extensive on record, but all indications are it is finally coming to a close,” said MRO Project Scientist Rich Zurek at JPL. “MARCI images of the Opportunity site have shown no active dust storms for some time within 3,000 kilometers [about 1,900 miles] of the rover site.”With skies clearing, mission managers are hopeful the rover will attempt to call home, but they are also prepared for an extended period of silence. \"If we do not hear back after 45 days, the team will be forced to conclude that the Sun-blocking dust and the Martian cold have conspired to cause some type of fault from which the rover will more than likely not recover,\" said Callas. At that point, the team will report to NASA HQ to determine whether to continue with the strategy or adjust it. Callas added, \"In the unlikely chance that there is a large amount of dust sitting on the solar arrays that is blocking the Sun\\'s energy, we will continue passive listening efforts for several months.\"The additional several months for passive listening are an allowance for the possibility that a Red Planet dust devil could come along and literally dust off Opportunity’s solar arrays. Such “cleaning events” were first discovered by Mars rover teams in 2004 when, on several occasions, battery power levels aboard both Spirit and Opportunity increased by several percent during a single Martian night, when the logical expectation was that they would continue to decrease. These cleaning dust devils have even been imaged by both rovers on the surface and spacecraft in orbit (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8lfJ0c7WQ8 and  https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/5307/the-serpent-dust-devil-of-mars/).The chances are small that dust accumulation would be the root cause of Opportunity’s lack of communication. Nonetheless, each day during the passive phase, JPL’s Radio Science group will scour the signal records taken by a very sensitive broadband receiver of radio frequencies emanating from Mars, looking for a sign that the rover is trying to reach out.Even if the team hears back from Opportunity during either phase, there is no assurance the rover will be operational. The impact of this latest storm on Opportunity’s systems is unknown but could have resulted in reduced energy production, diminished battery performance, or other unforeseen damage that could make it difficult for the rover to fully return online.While the situation in Perseverance Valley is critical, the rover team is cautiously optimistic, knowing that Opportunity has overcome significant challenges during its 14-plus years on Mars. The rover lost use of its front steering -- its left-front in June of 2017, and right front in 2005. Its 256-megabyte flash memory is no longer functioning. The team also knows that everything about the rover is well beyond its warranty period -- both Opportunity and its twin rover, Spirit, were constructed for 90-day missions (Spirit lasted 20 times longer and Opportunity is going on 60 times). The rovers were designed to travel about 1,000 yards, and Opportunity has logged more than 28 miles. Through thick and thin, the team has seen their rover soldier on. Now, Opportunity engineers and scientists of Opportunity are planning, and hoping, that this latest dilemma is just another bump in their Martian road.“In a situation like this you hope for the best but plan for all eventualities,” said Callas. “We are pulling for our tenacious rover to pull her feet from the fire one more time. And if she does, we will be there to hear her.”Updates on the dust storm and tau can be found here.JPL, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, built Opportunity and manages the mission for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate, Washington.For more information about Opportunity, visit:https://www.nasa.gov/rovershttps://mars.nasa.gov/mer/News media contactsDC Agle / Andrew Good\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\\n818-393-9011 / 818-393-2433\\nagle@jpl.nasa.gov  / Andrew.C.Good@jpl.nasa.govJoAnna Wendel\\nNASA Headquarters, Washington\\n202-358-1003\\nJoanna.r.wendel@nasa.gov', 'Less than 2 minutes after the launch of a 58-foot-tall (17.7-meter) Black Brant IX sounding rocket, a payload separated and began its dive back through Earth\\'s atmosphere. When onboard sensors determined the payload had reached the appropriate height and Mach number (38 kilometers altitude, Mach 1.8), the payload deployed a parachute. Within four-tenths of a second, the 180-pound parachute billowed out from being a solid cylinder to being fully inflated.It was the fastest inflation in history of a parachute this size and created a peak load of almost 70,000 pounds of force.This wasn\\'t just any parachute. The mass of nylon, Technora and Kevlar fibers that make up the parachute will play an integral part in landing NASA\\'s state-of-the-art Mars 2020 rover on the Red Planet in February 2021. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory\\'s Advanced Supersonic Parachute Inflation Research Experiment (ASPIRE) project conducted a series of sounding rocket tests to help decide which parachute design to use on the Mars 2020 mission.Two different parachutes were evaluated during ASPIRE. The first test flight carried almost an exact copy of the parachute used to land NASA\\'s Mars Science Laboratory successfully on the Red Planet in 2012. The second and third tests carried chutes of similar dimensions but reinforced with stronger materials and stitching.On Oct. 3, NASA\\'s Mars 2020 mission management and members of its Entry, Descent, and Landing team met at JPL in Pasadena, California, and determined that the strengthened parachute had passed its tests and was ready for its Martian debut. \"Mars 2020 will be carrying the heaviest payload yet to the surface of Mars, and like all our prior Mars missions, we only have one parachute and it has to work,\" said John McNamee, project manager of Mars 2020 at JPL. \"The ASPIRE tests have shown in remarkable detail how our parachute will react when it is first deployed into a supersonic flow high above Mars. And let me tell you, it looks beautiful.\"The 67,000-pound (37,000-kilogram) load was the highest ever survived by a supersonic parachute. That\\'s about an 85-percent higher load than what scientists would expect the Mars 2020 parachute to encounter during its deployment in Mars\\' atmosphere.\"Earth\\'s atmosphere near the surface is much denser than that near the Martian surface, by about 100 times,\" said Ian Clark, the test\\'s technical lead from JPL. \"But high up – around 23 miles (37 kilometers) – the atmospheric density on Earth is very similar to 6 miles (10 kilometers) above Mars, which happens to be the altitude that Mars 2020 will deploy its parachute.\"With the ASPIRE tests complete, the endeavors of Clark and his compatriots will be confined to the lower part of the stratosphere for the time being. But that doesn\\'t mean the fun times are over.\"We are all about helping 2020 stick its landing 28 months from now,\" said Clark. \"I may not get to shoot rockets to the edge of space for a while, but when it comes to Mars – and when it comes to getting there and getting down there safely – there are always exciting challenges to work on around here.\"The Mars 2020 project\\'s parachute-testing series, ASPIRE, is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with support from NASA\\'s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and NASA\\'s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, for NASA\\'s Space Science Mission Directorate.

Unlike the space agency\\'s rovers, InSight is a lander designed to study an entire planet from just one spot.This sedentary science allows InSight to detect geophysical signals deep below the Martian surface, including marsquakes and heat. Scientists will also be able to track radio signals from the stationary spacecraft, which vary based on the wobble in Mars\\' rotation. Understanding this wobble could help solve the mystery of whether the planet\\'s core is solid.Here are five things to know about how InSight conducts its science.1. InSight Can Measure Quakes Anywhere on the PlanetQuakes on Earth are usually detected using networks of seismometers. InSight has only one – called SEIS (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure) – so its science team will use some creative measurements to analyze seismic waves as they occur anywhere on the planet.SEIS will measure seismic waves from marsquakes and meteorite strikes as they move through Mars. The speed of those waves changes depending on the material they\\'re traveling through, helping scientists deduce what the planet\\'s interior is made of.Seismic waves come in a surprising number of flavors. Some vibrate across a planet\\'s surface, while others ricochet off its center. They also move at different speeds. Seismologists can use each type as a tool to triangulate where and when a seismic event has happened.This means InSight could have landed anywhere on Mars and, without moving, gathered the same kind of science.2. InSight\\'s Seismometer Needs Peace and QuietSeismometers are touchy by nature. They need to be isolated from \"noise\" in order to measure seismic waves accurately.SEIS is sensitive enough to detect vibrations smaller than the width of a hydrogen atom. It will be the first seismometer ever set on the Martian surface, where it will be thousands of times more accurate than seismometers that sat atop the Viking landers.To take advantage of this exquisite sensitivity, engineers have given SEIS a shell: a wind-and-thermal shield that InSight\\'s arm will place over the seismometer. This protective dome presses down when wind blows over it; a Mylar-and-chainmail skirt keeps wind from blowing in. It also gives SEIS a cozy place to hide away from Mars\\' intense temperature swings, which can create minute changes in the instrument\\'s springs and electronics.3. InSight Has a Self-Hammering NailHave you ever tried to hammer a nail? Then you know holding it steady is key. InSight carries a nail that also needs to be held steady.This unique instrument, called HP3 (Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package), holds a spike attached to a long tether. A mechanism inside the spike will hammer it up to 16 feet (5 meters) underground, dragging out the tether, which is embedded with heat sensors.At that depth, it can detect heat trapped inside Mars since the planet first formed. That heat shaped the surface with volcanoes, mountain ranges and valleys. It may even have determined where rivers ran early in Mars\\' history.4. InSight Can Land in a Safe SpotBecause InSight needs stillness – and because it can collect seismic and heat data from anywhere on the planet – the spacecraft is free to land in the safest location possible.InSight\\'s team selected a location on Mars\\' equator called Elysium Planitia – as flat and boring a spot as any on Mars. That makes landing just a bit easier, as there\\'s less to crash into, fewer rocks to land on and lots of sunlight to power the spacecraft. The fact that InSight doesn\\'t use much power and should have plenty of sunlight at Mars\\' equator means it can provide lots of data for scientists to study.5. InSight Can Measure Mars\\' WobbleInSight has two X-band antennas on its deck that make up a third instrument, called RISE (Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment). Radio signals from RISE will be measured over months, maybe even years, to study the tiny \"wobble\" in the rotation of the planet. That wobble is a sign of whether Mars\\' core is liquid or solid – a trait that could also shed light on the planet\\'s thin magnetic field.Collecting detailed data on this wobble hasn\\'t happened since Mars Pathfinder\\'s three-month mission in 1997 (although the Opportunity rover made a few measurements in 2011 while it remained still, waiting out the winter). Every time a stationary spacecraft sends radio signals from Mars, it can help scientists improve their measurements.About InSightJPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate. InSight is part of NASA\\'s Discovery Program, managed by the agency\\'s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Lockheed Martin Space in Denver built the InSight spacecraft, including its cruise stage and lander, and supports spacecraft operations for the mission.A number of European partners, including France\\'s Centre National d\\'Études Spatiales (CNES) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), support the InSight mission.

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech. Download image and captionOne of the twin MarCO CubeSats snapped this image of Mars on Oct. 3 – the first image of the Red Planet ever produced by this class of tiny, low-cost spacecraft. The two CubeSats are officially called MarCO-A and MarCO-B but nicknamed \"EVE\" and \"Wall-E\" by their engineering team.A wide-angle camera on top of MarCO-B produced the image as a test of exposure settings. The MarCO mission, led by NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, hopes to produce more images as the CubeSats approach Mars ahead of Nov. 26. That\\'s when they\\'ll demonstrate their communications capabilities while NASA\\'s InSight spacecraft attempts to land on the Red Planet. (The InSight mission won\\'t rely on them, however; NASA\\'s Mars orbiters will be relaying the spacecraft\\'s data back to Earth.)This image was taken from a distance of roughly 8 million miles (12.8 million kilometers) from Mars. The MarCOs are \"chasing\" Mars, which is a moving target as it orbits the Sun. In order to be in place for InSight\\'s landing, the CubeSats have to travel roughly 53 million miles (85 million kilometers). They have already traveled 248 million miles (399 million kilometers).MarCO-B\\'s wide-angle camera looks straight out from the deck of the CubeSat. Parts related to the spacecraft\\'s high-gain antenna are visible on either side of the image. Mars appears as a small red dot at the right of the image.To take the image, the MarCO team had to program the CubeSat to rotate in space so that the deck of its boxy \"body\" was pointing at Mars. After several test images, they were excited to see that clear, red pinprick.\"We\\'ve been waiting six months to get to Mars,\" said Cody Colley, MarCO\\'s mission manager at JPL. \"The cruise phase of the mission is always difficult, so you take all the small wins when they come.

Imagine trying to play that game when the claw is on Mars, the objects you\\'re trying to grasp are far more fragile than a stuffed bear and all you have is a stitched-together panorama of the environment you\\'re working in. Oh, and there might be a dust storm.NASA\\'s InSight lander, slated to arrive on Mars Nov. 26, 2018, will be the first mission to use a robotic arm to grasp instruments from the spacecraft and release them into place on another planet. These instruments will help scientists study the deep interior of Mars for the first time.\"We have a lot riding on InSight\\'s robotic arm, so we\\'ve been practicing our version of the claw game dozens of times,\" said Tom Hoffman, InSight\\'s project manager at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"The difference, of course, is that, unlike the claw machine designers, our robotic arm team works hard to allow us to win every time.\"InSight\\'s robotic arm (called the Instrument Deployment Arm) will pick up two sensitive science packages from the spacecraft deck and gently lower them to the ground: the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, which will assess Mars\\' interior energy, and the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, which will study vibrations of the ground set off by marsquakes and meteorite impacts. InSight also needs to place a Wind and Thermal Shield over the seismometer, like a cloche -- or rounded dish cover -- at a fancy dinner service.\"The robotic arm has to place everything perfectly,\" said Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu, team lead for InSight\\'s instrument deployment system operations at JPL. \"But we like a challenge.\"Luckily, engineers didn\\'t have to start from scratch. The JPL engineering team had in storage a leftover robotic arm -- made for the Mars Surveyor 2001 lander mission that never flew. The arm wasn\\'t as beefy as ones built for missions like the Mars Curiosity Rover, which carries more weight at the end of its arm. But the 2001 arm was designed for lifting, making it appropriate for InSight\\'s mission. And it was long (5.9 feet, or 1.8 meters, to be exact). InSight needs to put the seismometer and heat probe a significant distance away from itself for the sensitive instruments to function optimally.As with any vintage machine, engineers had to refurbish the arm and customize it for InSight. They pulled it apart, replaced some pieces, relubricated it and repainted it. Engineers also added a color camera and a grapple (the claw).The original grapple design had two stiff \"toes\" emanating from a central base, which Trebi-Ollennu likens to a crow\\'s foot. Each instrument was outfitted with a knob, or \"grapple point,\" that resembled a lollipop with a long stem for the stiff foot to grab. In tests on sloped surfaces, the lollipop often got stuck in the toes. Given the possibility of slight slopes at the InSight landing site, engineers didn\\'t want to take that chance.The second proposed design was an idea familiar to those who have seen junkyard operators maneuver crushed cars. Engineers hung a magnet on an umbilical cord from the robotic arm and put steel plates on the instruments. Tests showed, however, that dust collected on both the magnet\\'s surface and the instruments\\' steel plate, decreasing the ability of the two parts to stick together. Given that InSight\\'s landing date falls within the typical dust storm season on Mars, engineers decided against this magnet design.The third idea was the charm: a clawlike grapple with five metal fingers about the length of human fingers (about 2.5 inches, or 63 millimeters, long) hanging off the end of an umbilical cord to compensate for any slopes. The grapple point on each instrument resembled the original spherical lollipop, but with the top half of the sphere cut off and a shorter stem.An especially clever feature of this robotic hand, Trebi-Ollennu explained, is that melting of paraffin wax -- a common constituent of candles and crayons -- controls the opening of InSight\\'s fingers.To begin the process, an actuator heats a very pure paraffin wax to 84°F (29°C), which takes about 15 minutes in the average ambient Mars temperature of about minus 60°F (minus 50°C). The wax expands as it melts and pushes out a rod that pushes on a spring that opens the fingers. When the fingers open, a microswitch turns off the heater, and the cooling, contracting wax allows the rod -- and therefore the fingers -- to retract. At rest, the fingers are closed so that if the hand happens to lose power, it won\\'t drop an instrument.A few days after landing, InSight engineers will put the robotic arm into action. The arm will move so the camera attached to it can take images of the area around the lander site. Back on Earth, engineers will use those images to figure out where the instruments can be safely set down. They will also practice deploying the instruments in a Mars-like test bed at JPL. Once the team is confident that they have a robust plan -- which could take weeks -- the arm with its grapple will slowly begin to deploy those instruments for real on Mars.\"We\\'re looking forward to the demanding work of getting InSight\\'s claw machine in motion,\" said Bruce Banerdt, InSight\\'s principal investigator at JPL. \"But the prize for the InSight team won\\'t be a fuzzy bear.

The results of these deliberations will be provided to the Mars 2020 Project, which will incorporate them into a recommendation to NASA Headquarters in Washington, where final selection will be made. The announcement of the Mars 2020 landing site is expected to come by the end of the year.\"I have attended all the workshops so far, and none have disappointed when it comes to intelligent advocation and lively debate,\" said Farley. \"But this is what science is all about – the cogent and respectable exchange of ideas.

An exhibit highlighting the OnSight experience, \"Destination: Mars,\" had a limited run at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Center in 2016. \"Access Mars,\" a Google collaboration built on WebVR, was released in 2017 and runs on a desktop browser.NASA\\'s Software of the Year of the Year Award honors the best software developed at NASA. \"We are honored to receive this recognition and grateful for the investment that the institution has made in supporting this emerging technology,\" said Abercrombie.The following teams were selected for honorable mention:News Media ContactArielle SamuelsonJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\\n818-354-0307\\narielle.a.samuelson@jpl.nasa.gov', 'But that\\'s not why the Ferrari driver came to Campanella. He turned to him because John Campanella has been painting spacecraft for NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, for over two decades. And if Campanella\\'s work is good enough for the final frontier, his friend thought, it would be good enough for his black prancing stallion.\"We do a thousand different paint jobs a year at JPL, from components as small as a pill to entire spacecraft fuselages,\" said Campanella. \"I have worked on the first Mars rover Pathfinder, the Deep Impact mission, GRAIL, Juno and Cassini, and I think my paint is just about everywhere in the solar system. We just finished off the Mars 2020 chassis. And like just about everything else we work on, there is only one Mars 2020 rover. We had to get everything as close to perfect as we can get it.\"While there are thousands of steps that could be chosen to start a story about producing an SUV-sized, nuclear-powered six-wheel-drive vehicle for the Red Planet, we will begin ours four-and-a-half months before Campanella and his colleagues trained their highly-trained paint guns on the rover.In mid-April 2018, more than 20 freshly-machined, large, shiny chunks of 7050 and 7075 aluminum that would make up the primary structure of the chassis were collected in a clean room in Building 18 at JPL, along with about a hundred smaller secondary parts. Over the following four-and-a-half months, Mars 2020 engineers and technicians planned, measured, examined, consulted, drilled and fastened until those many parts became a single Mars rover chassis.\"The plan called for 610 rivets, 730 washers, 644 nuts and 964 mechanical fasteners to hold the rover chassis together,\" said Stephen Pakbaz, lead engineer for the Mars 2020 chassis assembly. \"That means there are well over 1,000 holes in the Mars 2020 rover. But in almost all cases we don\\'t just drill once for each hole; we drill three or more times -- entirely by hand.\"Each hole in Mars 2020\\'s chassis began its life as a hand-drilled pilot hole. Next, a larger bit is introduced to expand the hole slightly. Then a final drilling of the same hole takes place.\"We drill holes in steps because it gives us the best chance to catch any errors, stresses the metal less, and the increments make it easier to drill by hand,\" said Pakbaz. \"It\\'s detailed work and at times can be tedious, but everyone knows what is at stake.\"At the end of 5,000 engineering hours of assembly, involving more than 3,000 drillings and well beyond a thousand rivet and fastener applications, the rover\\'s chassis was complete. But it still was not ready for the paint guns of Campanella\\'s team. There are locations on the rover\\'s chassis where paint is strictly verboten -- places where electronics boxes have yet to be bolted on, wiring harnesses are still to be run and attachment points for hypersensitive science instruments that require bare metal surfaces to perform their best.\"Any good paint job is preceded by a great tape job,\" said Campanella. \"I wouldn\\'t freestyle flames on a Camaro, and we sure don\\'t freestyle Mars rovers.\"So on Aug. 1, 2018, the drills and rivet guns in Building 18 Room 102 vanished from sight, and in their place materialized metal stencils, tape measurers and roll upon roll of masking tape.\"You can find the masking tape we used on 2020 in just about any hardware store,\" said Ryan van Schilifgaarde, a support engineer for Mars 2020 assembly. \"But whereas you would probably tear off a strip with your hands and eyeball it onto the wall you wanted to paint in your house, we use a computer-controlled cutter to make sure each piece is exactly the size and shape we want it to be.\"Numbering more than 600, the pieces of masking tape for the rover came in all shapes and sizes. Many were smaller than a coin, but a few were about the size of a bagel, and one (covering where fiber optic cable channel will go) was shaped like a serpent and as large as a microwave oven. All were applied by hand and smoothed out to prevent bubbling.\"One hundred and thirty-five temporary sheet-metal stencils also were applied during this time,\" said van Schilifgaarde. \"They mask larger locations on the rover that require a more rigid cover during this part of the build.\"The masking team measured success by the millimeter, and more than one application of masking tape had to be recut and reapplied after a visit from Quality Assurance. But with five Mars 2020 engineers logging 500 hours over seven days, the task was finally complete. On Aug. 6, 2018, the Mars 2020 rover chassis -- festooned with metal overlays and masking tape, and then covered in sterile antistatic wrap -- was gingerly forklifted 150 yards from Building 18 to JPL\\'s paint shop.\"With any spacecraft, after you get the static wrap off and inspect the rover, you start with surface prep -- abrading the surface with sand paper so the paint will adhere better,\" said Campanella. \"To prevent any chance of corrosion or oxidation, the rule is, once you start sanding, you have six hours to complete everything -- sanding, priming and painting.\"As spacecraft paint jobs go, the Mars 2020 rover was big, and occupied much of the paint room. Because of the rover\\'s size, Campanella worked with just two other people from his six-person team: Patrick Esquivias and their assistant Eddie Castro. Up until two years ago Esquivias had been an aircraft mechanic. This was his first rover. Up until eight months ago, Castro painted houses. This was his 12th spacecraft.The small team took on the rover in stages. They painted the top deck first, then let things cure for a day before tackling the sides. Another day off and they finished with the front and back. Even with the job spread out, sanding and meticulously cleaning the results of said sanding ate up over two of the six available hours.But time constraints are just part of the paint job for Campanella\\'s team. Whether it\\'s an Earth orbiter, Mars lander or something destined for the outer planets, standardization, fastidiousness and a steady hand are always the order of the day.\"You can\\'t think about where it\\'s going or how much history it can make,\" said Campanella. \"We use the same paint guns on the same setting and fire them from the same distance and move at the same speed each and every time.\"The primer and paint used on Mars 2020 are far from hardware-store variety. Along with being able to adhere to aluminum, they have been proven through rigorous testing to be able to endure the jolts, vibrations, UV rays and other indignities of a trip to Mars, as well as be hearty enough to survive the Martian cold -- all the while not outgassing organic compounds and other materials that could affect the mission\\'s science experiments.In less than 10 minutes, all the gleaming aluminum and beige masking tape disappeared under Esquivias\\' steady hand. But before the first layer of flat white had a chance to dry, Esquivias made his way back to the starting point to apply a second coat -- the still-tacky first coat helping make a stronger bond between layers. Then the process was repeated a third and final time.Less than five hours in, the first painting session on the Mars 2020 rover chassis drew to a close.Esquivias had been aiming to coat the chassis in a blanket of paint between 4 and 6 mils (or thousandths of an inch) thick. But he would not know until later the next day how they did because the test equipment that Quality Assurance uses to evaluate paint application must come into contact with the painted chassis to provide an accurate readout. And nobody wants to ruin a good paint job.Even before Quality Assurance could weigh in, Campanella declared Esquivias\\' first rover a success. \"We paint every day, and when we are not painting we are practicing. He nailed it.\"The next day, Quality Assurance confirmed that Esquivias had nailed it.On Aug. 14, the Mars 2020 rover chassis was again carefully sheathed in antistatic wrap and transported \"up the hill\" to Building 144, where it would be baked in a vacuum chamber.\"Cooking the chassis at 230°F (110°C) in a vacuum for three days not only hardens the paint, it literally bakes out contaminants from the paint that could possibly outgas in flight,\" said Pakbaz. \"Since Mars 2020 is an astrobiology mission, ensuring Mars samples have not been contaminated is paramount. Baking the rover goes a long way to making that possible.\"On Monday, Aug. 20, the rover chassis came out of the oven. After inspection, it was again covered in sterile, antistatic film and returned to the clean room in Building 18 for some final touches and inspections. About two weeks later, on Sept. 5, a forklift gently carried the assembled, painted and baked chassis at no more than 3 mph back down the hill, a half-mile to JPL\\'s Spacecraft Assembly Facility High Bay 1, where it took its place next to the cruise and descent stages tasked with getting the rover safely to Mars.A few days after the chassis arrived, John Campanella appeared in the gallery overlooking the high bay. With him were Esquivias and Castro.\"When we are in the paint room, it is all about business,\" said Campanella. \"But now that our job is done, I wanted to make sure they took a moment to let it sink in that they are part of a dedicated team of professionals working on a historic mission of exploration.\"\"It may not have flames or racing stripes,\" he added, \"but it still looks beautiful.\"Mars 2020 will launch from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida and is expected to reach Mars in February 2021.The Mars 2020 project at JPL in Pasadena, California, manages rover development for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington.

That object is Opportunity, which was descending into the Martian valley when a dust storm swept over the region a little more than 100 days ago.The storm was one of several that stirred up enough dust to enshroud most of the Red Planet and block sunlight from reaching the surface. The lack of sunlight caused the solar-powered Opportunity to go into hibernation.The rover's team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, hasn't heard from it since. On Sept. 11, JPL began increasing the frequency of commands it beams to the 14-year-old rover.The tau -- a measurement of how much sunlight reaches the surface -- over Opportunity was estimated to be a little higher than 10 during some points during the dust storm.

Image credit: University of Colorado/NASA\\nFull image and captionToday, NASA’s MAVEN spacecraft celebrates four years in orbit studying the upper atmosphere of the Red Planet and how it interacts with the Sun and the solar wind. To mark the occasion, the team has released a selfie image of the spacecraft at Mars.“MAVEN has been a tremendous success,” said Bruce Jakosky, MAVEN principal investigator from the University of Colorado, Boulder. “The spacecraft and instruments continue to operate as planned, and we’re looking forward to further exploration of the Martian upper atmosphere and its influence on climate.” MAVEN has obtained a selfie image, looking at ultraviolet wavelengths of sunlight reflected off of components of the spacecraft.  The image was obtained with the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) instrument that normally looks at ultraviolet emissions from the Martian upper atmosphere.  The IUVS instrument is mounted on a platform at the end of a 1.2-m boom (its own “selfie stick”), and by rotating around, the boom can look back at the spacecraft.  The selfie was made from 21 different images, obtained with the IUVS in different orientations, that have been stitched together.The mission launched on Nov. 18, 2013, and went into orbit around Mars on Sept. 21, 2014. During its time at Mars, MAVEN has answered many questions about the Red Planet.The spacecraft has made the following discoveries and science results, among others:Next year, engineers will initiate an aerobraking maneuver by skimming the spacecraft through Mars’ upper atmosphere to slow it. This will reduce the highest altitude in MAVEN’s orbit to enhance its ability to serve as a communications relay for data from rovers on the surface. Currently, MAVEN carries out about one relay pass per week with one of the rovers. This number will increase after NASA’s InSight mission lands on Mars in November.MAVEN completed its primary mission in November 2015 and has been operating in an extended mission since that time, continuing its productive investigation of Mars’ upper atmosphere and exploring additional opportunities for science that the new relay orbit will bring.MAVEN’s principal investigator is based at the University of Colorado’s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, Boulder. The university provided two science instruments and leads science operations, as well as education and public outreach, for the mission. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the MAVEN project and provided two science instruments for the mission. Lockheed Martin built the spacecraft and is responsible for mission operations. The University of California at Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory also provided four science instruments for the mission. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, provides navigation and Deep Space Network support, as well as the Electra telecommunications relay hardware and operations.For more information on the MAVEN mission, visit:https://www.nasa.gov/maven andhttp://lasp.colorado.edu/home/maven/', 'Engineer Joel Steinkraus uses sunlight to test the solar arrays on one of the Mars Cube One (MarCO) spacecraft. Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\\nFull image and captionThis summer, NASA has been flying the first two next-generation CubeSats to deep space. They\\'re currently on their way to Mars, trailing thousands of miles behind the InSight spacecraft. InSight and its CubeSat tag-alongs are already more than halfway to the Red Planet.The mini-mission, called Mars Cube One (MarCO), has already proved this class of spacecraft can survive the deep-space environment. It will next test the use of miniaturized communication technology to relay data when InSight attempts to land in November. Relaying landing data is one of the jobs of NASA\\'s orbiters, which will record InSight\\'s descent; engineers learn more from every landing attempt. MarCO will test whether this technology can ably perform the relay job for future missions.To complete their mission, the MarCOs have miniature high-gain antennas and radios that can communicate with Earth from roughly 93 million miles away. Their propulsion systems are capable of steering towards Mars; each MarCO completed its second steering maneuver in August. They even have color cameras, one of which snapped the first image from a CubeSat of the Earth and the Moon -- proof of just how far this technology has literally come.MarCO is still experimental. It\\'s meant to demonstrate that spacecraft technology can be shrunk into a tiny package and still do something useful in deep space. And while CubeSats will never compete with the larger and more complex spacecraft NASA usually flies, the MarCO spacecraft are pioneering a new class of robotic exploration.\"Our hope is that MarCO could help democratize deep space,\" said Jakob Van Zyl, director of the Solar System Exploration Directorate at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"The technology is cheap enough that you could envision countries entering space that weren\\'t players in the past. Even universities could do this.\"A Legacy of PathfindersJPL initiated and built MarCO, just one of several CubeSat projects the Lab has developed. JPL is a natural place to host CubeSats: The Lab built the first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, which discovered the Van Allen radiation belts in 1958. Not unlike a CubeSat, it was a small, rudimentary spacecraft. The history of the U.S. space program followed in its wake.JPL later built a Mars mini-rover called Sojourner that took baby steps in 1997 and proved to be a trial run for NASA\\'s Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity rovers.Innovation often begins with pathfinder technology, Van Zyl said. Once engineers prove something can be done, science missions follow.\"When it comes to innovation, MarCO is in the same class as Explorer 1 and Sojourner,\" Van Zyl said. \"The question is: Can we use CubeSats to do more science? Not all science, because they\\'re too limited to carry many instruments. But this technology creates a vehicle for people to do science at a much lower investment to the taxpayer.\"NASA has already committed to answering the question. Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the agency\\'s Science Mission Directorate, is a proponent of CubeSats; last month, he announced NASA will be funding $100 million worth of SmallSat science missions each year.Preparing for Future CubeSatsMarCO has already laid the groundwork for future exploration with small spacecraft.\"Almost all the features of MarCO are being adapted for use on future spacecraft,\" said John Baker, the program manager responsible for small spacecraft at JPL. \"And many parts started with a commercial partner\\'s product that was modified.\"The role of MarCO\\'s commercial partners can\\'t be overstated. Its solar panels, cameras, avionics, propulsion systems and attitude-control systems were all provided by commercial contractors. One advantage of CubeSats is they can use standardized parts and systems, allowing private companies to lower the price of new technology. Lower-cost spacecraft also mean engineers can take more design risks, testing that technology in space.Van Zyl said that MarCO\\'s main goal was to prove CubeSats can survive the harsh journey to deep space. MarCO\\'s team can check that box off their list.They\\'re already focused on their next goal: Mars is just a few months and 68 million miles (110 million kilometers) away.For more information about MarCO, visit:https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cubesat/missions/marco.phpNews Media ContactAndrew Good\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\\n818-393-2433\\nandrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov', 'After snagging a new rock sample on Aug. 9, NASA\\'s Curiosity rover surveyed its surroundings on Mars, producing a 360-degree panorama of its current location on Vera Rubin Ridge.The panorama includes umber skies, darkened by a fading global dust storm. It also includes a rare view by the Mast Camera of the rover itself, revealing a thin layer of dust on Curiosity\\'s deck. In the foreground is the rover\\'s most recent drill target, named \"Stoer\" after a town in Scotland near where important discoveries about early life on Earth were made in lakebed sediments.The new drill sample delighted Curiosity\\'s science team, because the rover\\'s last two drill attempts were thwarted by unexpectedly hard rocks. Curiosity started using a new drill method earlier this year to work around a mechanical problem. Testing has shown it to be as effective at drilling rocks as the old method, suggesting the hard rocks would have posed a problem no matter which method was used.There\\'s no way for Curiosity to determine exactly how hard a rock will be before drilling it, so for this most recent drilling activity, the rover team made an educated guess. An extensive ledge on the ridge was thought to include harder rock, able to stand despite wind erosion; a spot below the ledge was thought more likely to have softer, erodible rocks. That strategy seems to have panned out, but questions still abound as to why Vera Rubin Ridge exists in the first place.The rover has never encountered a place with so much variation in color and texture, according to Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity\\'s project scientist at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. JPL leads the Mars Science Laboratory mission that Curiosity is a part of.\"The ridge isn\\'t this monolithic thing -- it has two distinct sections, each of which has a variety of colors,\" Vasavada said. \"Some are visible to the eye and even more show up when we look in near-infrared, just beyond what our eyes can see. Some seem related to how hard the rocks are.\"The best way to discover why these rocks are so hard is to drill them into a powder for the rover\\'s two internal laboratories. Analyzing them might reveal what\\'s acting as \"cement\" in the ridge, enabling it to stand despite wind erosion. Most likely, Vasavada said, groundwater flowing through the ridge in the ancient past had a role in strengthening it, perhaps acting as plumbing to distribute this wind-proofing \"cement.\"Much of the ridge contains hematite, a mineral that forms in water. There\\'s such a strong hematite signal that it drew the attention of NASA orbiters like a beacon. Could some variation in hematite result in harder rocks? Is there something special in the ridge\\'s red rocks that makes them so unyielding?For the moment, Vera Rubin Ridge is keeping its secrets to itself.Two more drilled samples are planned for the ridge in September. After that, Curiosity will drive to its scientific end zone: areas enriched in clay and sulfate minerals higher up Mt. Sharp. That ascent is planned for early October.News Media Contact:Andrew Good\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\\n818-393-2433\\nandrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov', 'Ambitious climbers, forget Mt. Everest. Dream about Mars.The Red Planet has some of the tallest mountains in the solar system. They include Olympus Mons, a volcano nearly three times the height of Everest. It borders a region called the Tharsis plateau, where three equally awe-inspiring volcanoes dominate the landscape.But what geologic processes created these features on the Martian surface?  Scientists have long wondered -- and may soon know more.NASA and DLR (German Aerospace Center) plan to take the planet\\'s temperature for the first time ever, measuring how heat flows out of the planet and drives this inspiring geology. Detecting this escaping heat will be a crucial part of a mission called InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport), managed by NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.InSight will be the first mission to study Mars\\' deep interior, using its Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3) instrument to measure heat as it is conducted from the interior to the planet\\'s surface. This energy was in part captured when Mars formed more than 4 billion years ago, preserving a record of its creation. That energy is also due to the decay of radioactive elements in the rocky interior.The way heat moves through a planet\\'s mantle and crust determines what surface features it will have, said Sue Smrekar of JPL, the mission\\'s deputy principal investigator and the deputy lead for HP3.\"Most of the planet\\'s geology is a result of heat,\" Smrekar said. \"Volcanic eruptions in the ancient past were driven by the flow of this heat, pushing up and constructing the towering mountains Mars is famous for.\"While scientists have modeled the interior structure of Mars, InSight will provide the first opportunity to find ground truth -- by literally looking below the ground.HP3, built and operated by DLR, will be placed on the Martian surface after InSight lands on Nov. 26, 2018. A probe called a mole will pummel the ground, burying itself and dragging a tether behind it. Temperature sensors embedded in this tether will measure the natural internal heat of Mars.That\\'s no easy task. The mole has to burrow deep enough to escape the wide temperature swings of the Martian surface. Even the spacecraft\\'s own \"body heat\" could affect HP3\\'s super-sensitive readings.\"If the mole gets stuck higher up than expected, we can still measure the temperature variation,\" said HP3 investigation lead Tilman Spohn of DLR. \"Our data will have more noise, but we can subtract out daily and seasonal weather variations by comparing it with ground-temperature measurements.\"In addition to burrowing, the mole will give off heat pulses. Scientists will study how quickly the mole warms the surrounding rock, allowing them to figure out how well heat is conducted by the rock grains at the landing site. Densely packed grains conduct heat better -- an important piece of the equation for determining Mars\\' internal energy.Cooking up a new planetFor an example of planetary heat flow, imagine a pot of water on a stove.As water heats, it expands, becomes less dense, and rises. The cooler, denser water sinks to the bottom, where it heats up. This cycling of cool to hot is called convection. The same thing happens inside a planet, churning rock over millions of years.Just as expanding bubbles can push off a pot lid, volcanoes are lids being blown off the top of a world. They shape a planet\\'s surface in the process. Most of the atmosphere on rocky planets forms as volcanoes expel gas from deep below. Some of Mars\\' biggest dry river beds are believed to have formed when the Tharsis volcanoes spewed gas into the atmosphere. That gas contained water vapor, which cooled into liquid and may have formed the channels surrounding Tharsis.The smaller the planet, the faster it loses its original heat. Since Mars is only one-third the size of Earth, most of its heat was lost early in its history. Most Martian geologic activity, including volcanism, occurred in the planet\\'s first billion years. \"We want to know what drove the early volcanism and climate change on Mars,\" Spohn said. \"How much heat did Mars start with? How much was left to drive its volcanism?\"NASA\\'s orbiters have given scientists a \"macro\" view of the planet, allowing them to study Martian geology from above. HP3 will offer a first look at the inside of Mars.\"Planets are kind of like an engine, driven by heat that moves their internal parts around,\" Smrekar said. \"With HP3, we\\'ll be lifting the hood on Mars\\' engine for the first time.\"What scientists learn during the InSight mission won\\'t just apply to Mars. It will teach them how all rocky planets formed -- including Earth, its Moon and even planets in other solar systems.More information about InSight is at:https://mars.nasa.gov/insightJPL, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, California, manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

InSight is part of NASA\\'s Discovery Program, managed by the agency\\'s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The InSight spacecraft, including cruise stage and lander, was built and tested by Lockheed Martin Space in Denver. A number of European partners, including France\\'s Centre National d\\'Études Spatiales (CNES) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), are supporting the InSight mission.For more information on InSight, visit:\\nhttps://mars.nasa.gov/insight/Interact with the mission on social media:\\nhttps://twitter.com/NASAInSight\\nhttps://facebook.com/NASAInSightNews Media ContactsStephanie L. Smith \\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\\n818-393-5463 \\nslsmith@jpl.nasa.gov \\n\\nJason Townsend \\nNASA Headquarters, Washington\\n202-358-0359\\njason.c.townsend@nasa.gov ', 'NASA\\'s InSight spacecraft, en route to a Nov. 26 landing on Mars, passed the halfway mark on Aug. 6. All of its instruments have been tested and are working well.As of Aug. 20, the spacecraft had covered 172 million miles (277 million kilometers) since its launch 107 days ago. In another 98 days, it will travel another 129 million miles (208 million kilometers) and touch down in Mars\\' Elysium Planitia region, where it will be the first mission to study the Red Planet\\'s deep interior. InSight stands for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport.The InSight team is using the time before the spacecraft\\'s arrival at Mars to not only plan and practice for that critical day, but also to activate and check spacecraft subsystems vital to cruise, landing and surface operations, including the highly sensitive science instruments.InSight\\'s seismometer, which will be used to detect quakes on Mars, received a clean bill of health on July 19. The SEIS instrument (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure) is a six-sensor seismometer combining two types of sensors to measure ground motions over a wide range of frequencies. It will give scientists a window into Mars\\' internal activity.\"We did our final performance checks on July 19, which were successful,\" said Bruce Banerdt, principal investigator of InSight from NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California.The team also checked an instrument that will measure the amount of heat escaping from Mars. After being placed on the surface, InSight\\'s Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3) instrument will use a self-hammering mechanical mole burrowing to a depth of 10 to 16 feet (3 to 5 meters). Measurements by sensors on the mole and on a science tether from the mole to the surface will yield the first precise determination of the amount of heat escaping from the planet\\'s interior. The checkout consisted of powering on the main electronics for the instrument, performing checks of its instrument sensor elements, exercising some of the instrument\\'s internal heaters, and reading out the stored settings in the electronics module. The third of InSight\\'s three main investigations -- Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment (RISE) -- uses the spacecraft\\'s radio connection with Earth to assess perturbations of Mars\\' rotation axis. These measurements can provide information about the planet\\'s core.\"We have been using the spacecraft\\'s radio since launch day, and our conversations with InSight have been very cordial, so we are good to go with RISE as well,\" said Banerdt.The lander\\'s cameras checked out fine as well, taking a spacecraft selfie of the inside of the spacecraft\\'s backshell. InSight Project Manager Tom Hoffman from JPL said that, \"If you are an engineer on InSight, that first glimpse of the heat shield blanket, harness tie-downs and cover bolts is a very reassuring sight as it tells us our Instrument Context Camera is operating perfectly. The next picture we plan to take with this camera will be of the surface of Mars.\"If all goes as planned, the camera will take the first image of Elysium Planitia minutes after InSight touches down on Mars.JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

CNES provided the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) instrument, with significant contributions from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany, the Swiss Institute of Technology (ETH) in Switzerland, Imperial College and Oxford University in the United Kingdom, and JPL.

Now that scientists think the global dust storm is \"decaying\" -- meaning more dust is falling out of the atmosphere than is being raised back into it -- skies might soon clear enough for the solar-powered rover to recharge and attempt to \"phone home.\"No one will know how the rover is doing until it speaks. But the team notes there’s reason to be optimistic: They’ve performed several studies on the state of its batteries before the storm, and temperatures at its location. Because the batteries were in relatively good health before the storm, there’s not likely to be too much degradation. And because dust storms tend to warm the environment -- and the 2018 storm happened as Opportunity’s location on Mars entered summer -- the rover should have stayed warm enough to survive.What will engineers at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, be looking for -- and what will those signs mean for recovery efforts?A tau below 2Dust storms on Mars block sunlight from reaching the surface, raising the level of a measurement called \"tau.\" The higher the tau, the less sunlight is available; the last tau measured by Opportunity was 10.8 on June 10. To compare, an average tau for its location on Mars is usually 0.5.JPL engineers predict that Opportunity will need a tau of less than 2.0 before the solar-powered rover will be able to recharge its batteries. A wide-angle camera on NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will watch for surface features to become visible as the skies clear. That will help scientists estimate the tau.Updates on the dust storm and tau can be found here.Two Ways to Listen for OpportunitySeveral times a week, engineers use NASA’s Deep Space Network, which communicates between planetary probes and Earth, to attempt to talk with Opportunity. The massive DSN antennas ping the rover during scheduled \"wake-up\" times, and then search for signals sent from Opportunity in response.In addition, JPL\\'s radio science group uses special equipment on DSN antennas that can detect a wider range of frequencies. Each day, they record any radio signal from Mars over most of the rover\\'s daylight hours, then search the recordings for Opportunity\\'s \"voice.\"Rover faults outWhen Opportunity experiences a problem, it can go into so-called \"fault modes\" where it automatically takes action to maintain its health. Engineers are preparing for three key fault modes if they do hear back from Opportunity.What happens if they hear back?After the first time engineers hear from Opportunity, there could be a lag of several weeks before a second time. It\\'s like a patient coming out of a coma: It takes time to fully recover. It may take several communication sessions before engineers have enough information to take action.The first thing to do is learn more about the state of the rover. Opportunity\\'s team will ask for a history of the rover\\'s battery and solar cells and take its temperature. If the clock lost track of time, it will be reset. The rover would take pictures of itself to see whether dust might be caked on sensitive parts, and test actuators to see if dust slipped inside, affecting its joints.Once they\\'ve gathered all this data, the team would take a poll about whether they\\'re ready to attempt a full recovery.Not out of the woodsEven if engineers hear back from Opportunity, there\\'s a real possibility the rover won’t be the same.The rover\\'s batteries could have discharged so much power -- and stayed inactive so long -- that their capacity is reduced. If those batteries can’t hold as much charge, it could affect the rover’s continued operations. It could also mean that energy-draining behavior, like running its heaters during winter, could cause the batteries to brown out.Dust isn’t usually as much of a problem. Previous storms plastered dust on the camera lenses, but most of that was shed off over time. Any remaining dust can be calibrated out.Send Opportunity a postcardDo you miss Opportunity as much as the rover\\'s team?
